## Overview

Analyzing weather data can provide valuable insights into climate trends, seasonal variations, and extreme weather events. This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis and visualization on a weather dataset to gain a deeper understanding of weather patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, visualization, and scripting.
- **Pandas**: A versatile data manipulation library for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.
- **Matplotlib**: A powerful visualization library for creating static, interactive, and dynamic visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A high-level interface to Matplotlib for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: An interactive environment for writing and running code, making it ideal for data analysis workflows.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains historical weather data, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other meteorological measurements. The data is available in a CSV format and can be accessed in the `data` directory.
